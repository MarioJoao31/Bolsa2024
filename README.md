# Jobshop Schedule Problem Comparison

This repository contains scripts for comparing the results and execution time of solving the Jobshop Schedule Problem using OR-Tools and Gurobi.

## Introduction

The Jobshop Schedule Problem is a classic optimization problem in which a set of jobs must be scheduled on a set of machines, subject to various constraints. In this project, we compare the performance of two popular optimization solvers, OR-Tools and Gurobi, in solving this problem.

## Installation

To run the scripts, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- OR-Tools (version X.X.X)
- Gurobi (version X.X.X)

Please refer to the official documentation of each solver for installation instructions.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Run the OR-Tools script:

    ```
    python or_tools_script.py
    ```

3. Run the Gurobi script:

    ```
    python gurobi_script.py
    ```

## Results

The results of the comparison are presented in the following table:

| Solver     | Execution Time (ms) | Solution Quality |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| OR-Tools   | X                   | X                |
| Gurobi     | X                   | X                |

## Conclusion

Based on the comparison, we can conclude that...
